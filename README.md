# Titanic Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the *Titanic dataset* to understand patterns in passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. Using *Python* and data science libraries, the goal is to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and apply basic analysis to gain insights about survival rates.

**Features:-**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on passenger demographics and survival rates

* Handling missing values and data preprocessing

* Visualization of patterns using graphs and plots

* Insights into how factors like age, gender, class, and fare affect survival

* Applying basic predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

**Technology Stack:-**

* Python 3.10

* Jupyter Notebook – interactive coding and visualization

* Pandas – for data manipulation

* NumPy – for numerical operations

* Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

* Scikit-learn – for applying machine learning models

**Dataset:-**

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. It contains passenger details such as:

* Passenger class (Pclass)

* Name, Sex, Age

* Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)

* Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)

* Ticket number, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked location

* Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
